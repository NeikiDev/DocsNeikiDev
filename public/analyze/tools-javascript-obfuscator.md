## How it Works
Our JavaScript obfuscator tool uses advanced obfuscation techniques, <br>
including string encoding and renaming of variables and functions,  <br>
to make your code unreadable. We also use base64 string encoding,  <br>
which converts your code into a series of characters that are difficult  <br>
to decode without the proper tools.

##  Best Protection Possible
Our obfuscator provides the best possible protection for your JavaScript code.  <br>
We have implemented several advanced security  <br>
features to ensure that your code is protected from reverse engineering,  <br>
tampering, and other malicious attacks.

##  Easy to Use
Our JavaScript obfuscator is designed to be easy to use, even for  <br>
those with limited programming experience. Simply upload your JavaScript  <br>
code to our tool, and we'll handle the rest. Our tool will obfuscate your  <br>
code and provide you with a new, protected version that you can use in your projects.
